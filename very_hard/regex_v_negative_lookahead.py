Example
txt = "Texas = no, California = yes, Florida = yes, Michigan = no"
pattern = "yourregularexpressionhere"

re.findall(pattern, txt) âžž ["Texas", "Michigan"]

pattern = r"(\b[A-Z]{1}[a-z]+\b)(?! = yes)"

result = re.findall(pattern, txt)
print(result)

txt = 'Texas = no, California = yes, Florida = yes, Michigan = no'

TestCase().assertEqual('(?!' in pattern, True, 'You must use negative lookahead.')
